# LEVEL_2

In this level we will use the previous scripts but we are going to work a max resolution of

## step_0 --> 0_working_at_1080.py

Execute the python script named '0_videocapture.py' to open a window in videocapture mode.  
The output should be something similar:   

[](resources/2_0.png?raw=true)  

As you can see FPS decreased until 5.0. Let's see what we can do for mitigate this side effect.
