# LEVEL_2

In this level we will use the previous scripts but we are going to work a max resolution of
1920x1080 trying to identify performance issuse (will be there!).

## step_0 --> 0_working_at_1080.py

Execute the python script named '0_working_at_1080.py' to open a window in videocapture mode with real-time landmarks 
detection and FPS counter at 1920x1080 fullscreen.  
The output should be something similar:   

![](resources/2_0.png?raw=true)  

As you can see, in the upper left side corner, the FPS counter decreased until 5.0.  
Let's see what we can do for mitigate this side effect.
